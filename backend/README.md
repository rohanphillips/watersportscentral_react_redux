WaterSportsCentral is a CMS that allows users to add/edit/collaborate on Water Sporting events and locations.

The overarching theme is to compile a full list of all water sporting types, locations where they're conducted and events both past and present that are conducted at each location.  There is currently a need to have a central place where a user can come to obtain this kind of information.
